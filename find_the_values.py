#1
A0 = dict(zip(('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)))
#A0 is a dictionary created by zipping the keys 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively. 
# The resulting dictionary is {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}.

#2
A1 = range(10)
# A1 is a range object representing the numbers from 0 to 9.

#3
A2 = sorted([i for i in A1 if i in A0])
# A2 is a sorted list comprehension that includes only the elements from A1 that are present in the keys of A0. 
# Since none of the keys in A0 are present in A1, A2 will be an empty list [].

#4
A3 = sorted([A0[s] for s in A0])
# A3 is a sorted list comprehension that creates a list with the values from A0 corresponding to each key in A0. 
# The resulting list will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

#5
A4 = [i for i in A1 if i in A3]


#A4 is a list comprehension that includes only the elements from A1 that are present in A3. 
# Since all the elements in A1 are present in A3, A4 will be the same as A1, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

#6
A5 = {i: i*i for i in A1}

# A5 is a dictionary comprehension that creates a dictionary where 
# each element i in A1 is a key, and the corresponding value is the square of i. 
# The resulting dictionary will be {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}.

#7
A6 = [[i, i*i] for i in A1]

# A6 is a list comprehension that creates a list of lists, where each inner list contains an element i from A1 followed by its square. 
# The resulting list will be [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 4], [3, 9], [4, 16], [5, 25], [6, 36], [7, 49], [8, 64], [9, 81]].
